tyrannosaurus[nb 1] is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur. the species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin),    often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the most well-represented of the large theropods.tyran%nosaurus lived thr$$is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids, and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event.

like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were short but unusually pow^^erful for their size and had two clawed digits. $$$$The most complete spe$$$$$cimen measures up to 12.3 meters (40 feet) in length though T. rex could grow to lengths of over 12.3 m (40 ft), up to 3.66 m (12 ft) tall at the hips, and according to most modern estimates 8.4 metric tons (9.3 short tons) to 14 metric tons (15.4 short tons) in weight. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in paleontology.most paleontologists today accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger.

more than fifty major specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex have been identified, some of which are nearly complete skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossi#@@significant research into many aspects of its biology, including%%%% its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology and potential speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a second Tyrannosaurus species while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus.

as the archetypal theropod, Tyrannosaurus has been one of the best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th century, and has been featured %in ^il#, advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.
